# Project Euler

My solutions to various problems on Project Euler.

I like to program in multiple languages, so I will often tackle a problem with whatever feels most comfortable to use.

Even though I have posted solutions in

* C#
* Haskell
* Python
* Scheme

I do not consider myself limited to those languages, as I will often test my ability with a language by solving problems.

My goal is to complete the first one hundred problems, and have my documented solutions posted for those interested in learning.
